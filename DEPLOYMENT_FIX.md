# 🚨 Critical Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified
The 404 error occurs because of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration issues between your frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render).

## ✅ What I Fixed
1. **Backend CORS Configuration**: Updated to allow requests from your Vercel domain
2. **Environment Configuration**: Created proper environment file for production

## 🚀 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Deploy Backend Changes
The backend CORS configuration has been updated. You need to redeploy your backend on Render:

1. Go to your [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Find your backend service
3. Click "Deploy Latest Commit" or the changes will auto-deploy

### 2. Verify Environment Variables on Vercel
Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard):

1. Select your project
2. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
3. Ensure you have:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://sweet-shop-management-backend.onrender.com
   ```
4. If not present, add it and redeploy

### 3. Force Redeploy Frontend
After updating environment variables:
1. Go to Deployments tab in Vercel
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. OR push a small commit to trigger auto-deployment

## 🔍 How to Verify the Fix

### Test 1: Check API Connectivity
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
fetch('https://sweet-shop-management-backend.onrender.com/api/health')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Backend health:', d))
```

### Test 2: Check CORS
Visit your app and open Network tab in browser dev tools:
1. Try to register/login
2. Look for the API request to your backend URL
3. Should show 200/401 status (not 404)

## 🛠️ Alternative Quick Fix
If the above doesn't work immediately, add this to your backend environment variables on Render:

```
FRONTEND_URL=https://sweet-shop-management-saketh.vercel.app
```

## 📞 Support
If you're still getting 404 errors after these steps:
1. Check the Network tab in browser dev tools
2. Verify the request URL is going to `sweet-shop-management-backend.onrender.com`
3. Check if there are any console errors

The fix should resolve the issue within 5-10 minutes after redeployment!
